# Overview #

I tried doing an MVC game with lots of state, and it was a mess. Here, I'll try to implement the same game in a more functional style.

The goals are:
+ Brush up on my rusty Ruby skills.
+ Build a game that I would love to play.

## Technologies ##
Ruby.

## Build Instructions ##
As I develop this, I'm going to update this readme with build instructions (a lofty goal, but I'll try). If you have ruby installed, cloning this repository and running 

```ruby src/application.rb```

 should get you rolling.
