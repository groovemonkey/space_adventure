repair should repair every ship in your fleet if possible
combat should let every ship in the fleet fight

after each ROUND of combat, give player a new choice? (escape, keep fighting)
ship upgrades (start with weapons)
method for placing custom events at specific gridpoints
trading
achievements
how to structure combat so player can update his take_damage stats?

more events
create weapons

LAUNCH: (stuff to only do once EVERYTHING ELSE IS DONE)

cool auto-generated ship descriptions, (put together from snippets based on crew size, weapon mounts, hull and armor stats, etc)
auto-generate events (from a basic "bucket" of event parts?)...or at least randomize consequences (rewards)

Done: #####

use minerals to repair ship
no combat on home planet (0,0)
enemies
combat
mining
auto-place events on Grid
are current events modifying stats properly? Does checking stats work properly?
processCommand should have a "stats" option that tells you your stats/achievements. It should be a DIFFERENT function than the existing
	-displayStats() function.
event system (random roll on each planet landing)
a few test-events
--- integrate MOVE command with sub-functions? i.e. a general move command that
		-makes sure move is permitted/possible
		-subtracts fuel
		-updates stats
		-calls a smaller function to actually make the move
movement system
auto-populate gridmap with planets
auto-generate planet names (combinations?)
split "gameclasses" classes into the appropriate files in /resources, update tests and files that reference them
move "generate ship" function into the ship initialize() function?
auto-generate shiptypes? Once per shipyard i.e. limited? Hope to get something REALLY awesome? (pearlescents)
command-lookup code...in application or logic? (right now in application under "main loop")
gridmap
autopopulate gridmap with planets
string it together into a playable game
