TODO:
###
event system (random roll on each planet landing)
a few test-events

###

Minor:
create weapons
auto-generate events
stattracker -- application or logic? How is it instantiated for a new game, loaded from a saved game?

LAUNCH: (stuff to only do once EVERYTHING ELSE IS DONE)
cool auto-generated ship descriptions, (put together from snippets based on crew size, weapon mounts, hull and armor stats, etc)



DONE:
--- integrate MOVE command with sub-functions? i.e. a general move command that
		-makes sure move is permitted/possible
		-subtracts fuel
		-updates stats
		-calls a smaller function to actually make the move
movement system
auto-populate gridmap with planets
auto-generate planet names (combinations?)
split "gameclasses" classes into the appropriate files in /resources, update tests and files that reference them
move "generate ship" function into the ship initialize() function?
auto-generate shiptypes? Once per shipyard i.e. limited? Hope to get something REALLY awesome? (pearlescents)
command-lookup code...in application or logic? (right now in application under "main loop")
gridmap
autopopulate gridmap with planets
string it together into a playable game
